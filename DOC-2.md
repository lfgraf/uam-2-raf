## üîÑ Current State Analysis

### What's Working Well
1. **Design System**: Comprehensive token-based system with good dark mode support
2. **Role Separation**: Clean URL-based role detection (`/dashboard/{role}/*`)
3. **Component Architecture**: Well-organized by role with shared components
4. **UI Polish**: Empty states, error states, loading states all implemented
5. **Dual-Role UX**: Role switcher integrated into sidebar

### What's Still Mock Data
1. **Campaigns**: Hardcoded campaign data in `AdvertiserDashboard.tsx`
2. **Properties**: Mock property data in publisher components
3. **Stats/Analytics**: All metrics are static mock data
4. **Wallet Connection**: UI exists but no actual blockchain integration
5. **User Authentication**: No real user session management
6. **Auctions**: Auction bids are displayed but not functional
