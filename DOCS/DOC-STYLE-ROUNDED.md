ok so you have a @public/cm.png saved. i think this is a direction of style we are going through. main change for now is the sidebar. i don't have all of the interactions and colors and don't want to change everything as of
now. Can you just mock a page let's say "advertiser-2" where i can see the color difference? also revamp the components ideally, we don't want anything rounded.
